## Introduction

OpenVINO™ toolkit is a comprehensive toolkit for quickly developing applications and solutions that solve a variety of tasks including emulation of human vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and many others. Based on latest generations of artificial neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recurrent and attention-based networks, the toolkit extends computer vision and non-vision workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance. It accelerates applications with high-performance, AI and deep learning inference deployed from edge to cloud.

The Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit\*:
- Enables CNN-based deep learning inference on the edge
- Supports heterogeneous execution across Intel® CPU, Intel® Integrated Graphics, Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2, and Intel® Vision Accelerator Design with Intel® Movidius™ VPUs
- Speeds time-to-market via an easy-to-use library of computer vision functions and pre-optimized kernels

The **runtime package** includes the following components installed by default:

| [Inference Engine](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_IE_DG_inference_engine_intro.html)               | This is the engine that runs the deep learning model. It includes a set of libraries for an easy inference integration into your applications.                                                                                                                                                                |

## System Requirements
The complete list of supported hardware is available in the [Release Notes](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/openvino-relnotes.html#inpage-nav-8).

The table below lists supported operating systems and Python* versions required to run the installation.

| Supported Operating System                                   | [Python* Version (64-bit)](https://www.python.org/) |

> **NOTE**: This package can be installed on other versions of Linux and Windows OSes, but only the specific versions above are fully validated.

## Install the Runtime Package

### Step 1. Set Up Python Virtual Environment

To avoid dependency conflicts, use a virtual environment. Skip this
   step only if you do want to install all dependencies globally.

Create virtual environment:
```sh
python -m pip install --user virtualenv 
python -m venv openvino_env
```

> **NOTE**: On Linux and macOS, you may need to type `python3` instead of
`python`. You may also need to [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

### Step 2. Activate Virtual Environment

On Linux and macOS:
```sh
source openvino_env/bin/activate
```
On Windows:
```sh
openvino_env\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3. Set Up and Update PIP to the Highest Version

Run the command below:
```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Step 4. Install the Package

Run the command below: <br>

   ```sh
   pip install openvino
   ```

### Step 5. Verify that the Package Is Installed

Run the command below:
```sh
python -c "from openvino.inference_engine import IECore"
```
   
If installation was successful, you will not see any error messages (no console output).

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required. Get it with "Build Tools for Visual Studio"

On Windows* some dependencies may require compilation from source when installing. To resolve this issue, you need to install [Build Tools for Visual Studio* 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019) and repeat package installation.

### ImportError: libpython3.7m.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

To resolve missing external dependency on Ubuntu*, execute the following command:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libpython3.7
```
